## üì¶ Installation 
#### Without package manager
To install it without the package manager, download the project as a zip file and extract it from the packages folder. From there, put the files either inside your assets folder or in your packages folder.
#### With package manager
Currently, only the development package is available. It's updated with each commit to the master branch.   

1. Open the package manager and click 'Add from Git url' in the top right corner
2. Paste in `https://github.com/Hertzole/gold-player.git#dev-package` and click enter
3. Wait an eternity for Unity to realize that you have installed the package.
4. It should now be installed. Either create it from scratch or import the "Complete" sample and modify that. I recommend the sample because it's currently quite a pain to set everything up...

## üî® Getting Started

‚ö† **DOCUMENTATION IS EXTREMELY SPARSE RIGHT NOW AND WILL PROBABLY REMAIN SO FOR QUITE A WHILE** ‚ö†

#### Setup a level editor
If you've installed it through the package manager, I recommend importing the "Complete" sample and start modifying that.

//TODO: Finish setup guide  
Start by creating an empty object and add the `Level Editor` component. Then assign the required fields.

#### Expose a field to the level editor
To expose a field or property to the level editor, you simply do  
```cs
[ExposeToLevelEditor(0)]
public float myField;
[ExposeToLevelEditor(1)]
public string MyProperty { get; set; }
```
**NOTICE! The IDs need to be unique and they are used for saving levels and fetching values! You should not change these after creating your exposed field!**
