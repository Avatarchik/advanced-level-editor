#### Setup a level editor
TODO
#### Expose a field to the level editor
To expose a field or property to the level editor, you simply do  
```cs
[ExposeToLevelEditor(0)]
public float myField;
[ExposeToLevelEditor(1)]
public string MyProperty { get; set; }
```
**NOTICE! The IDs need to be unique and they are used for saving levels and fetching values! You should not change these after creating your exposed field!**
